# pokemon-predictor
Personal experiments with different machine learning methods to predict Pokemon usage percentages
Utilizng gen9 OU usage data from Pokemon Showdown I attempt to predict next months usage percentage for specific pokemon.
I have currently implented:
Ridge Regression
LASSO Regression (too little parameters to be effective)
